All verification passes. Let me create the v2 archive:
Now let me verify the archive contents — confirm all key files are included and exclusions are clean:
---

# ✅ V2 Archive Ready for Download

## Archive Details

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **File** | `/home/z/my-project/download/stillwater-phase0-complete-v2.tar.gz` |
| **Size** | 1.8 MB |
| **Files in archive** | 212 |
| **SHA256** | `937354bc823cbee4b99c5dad200d35fd2cec6cf8b4e758aa4633111b6aa72a39` |

## What Changed Since V1

The v2 archive incorporates all 3 validation-driven fixes that were applied across the codebase and all 6 documentation files:

### Fix 1: Trigger.dev SDK Import Path (Critical)
- `services/workers/trigger.config.ts`: Changed `from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3"` → `from "@trigger.dev/sdk"` (root import per official Trigger.dev v4 docs)
- Updated across SKILL.md (§2.1, §9.9 Gotcha 1, §12 Lesson 16, §13.13), CLAUDE.md (Gotcha 1, Pitfall #15), AGENTS.md (Gotcha 1), PAD.md (§17.2 code example), MEP.md (Phase 8 header + F8-01 code example)

### Fix 5: Stripe snake_case Contradiction
- SKILL.md §9.4 line 1871: Changed "v22+ uses camelCase" → "Pre-v22 used camelCase; v22+ aligns with API wire format using snake_case" — now consistent with 4 other locations

### Fix 2: proxy.ts Runtime Language Softening
- `apps/web/proxy.ts` comment: "Edge runtime by default" → "Edge or Node.js runtime (Next.js 16 docs inconsistent on default)"
- Softened absolute "Edge by default" claims across all 6 docs (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, PAD.md, MEP.md) — the 2-layer auth pattern is correct regardless of runtime

## Verification Results (All 16 checks PASS)

## How to Use

1. **Download** `/home/z/my-project/download/stillwater-phase0-complete-v2.tar.gz`
2. **Extract**: `tar -xzf stillwater-phase0-complete-v2.tar.gz`
3. **Copy** the `stillwater/` directory contents into your local GitHub repo clone, overwriting existing files
4. **Review** changes with `git diff` / `git status`
5. **Commit**: `docs: align all docs + code with validation findings (Trigger.dev root import, Stripe snake_case fix, proxy.ts runtime softening)`
6. **Push** to your GitHub repo

After refreshing your repo:
```bash
pnpm install          # Regenerates node_modules from pnpm-lock.yaml
docker compose up -d  # Starts Postgres 17 + Redis 7
pnpm check-types      # Should pass (only expected TS18003)
pnpm lint             # Should pass (2/2 tasks, all rules active)
pnpm dev --filter=web # Boots Next.js 16 on localhost:3000
```

The codebase is Phase 0 complete, validated against external research, and ready for Phase 1 (Database Schema, Drizzle Migrations, Seed Data).

I'll analyze the app start log meticulously, section by section, to identify all potential issues.
Let me verify the critical findings against the actual codebase:
---

# App Start Log Validation Report

I've meticulously analyzed the log. Here are my findings, organized by severity:

---

## 🔴 Issue 1 (CRITICAL — Blocks Dev Server): `pnpm dev --filter=web` fails

### What happened
```
$ pnpm dev --filter=web
× No package found with name 'web' in workspace
```

### Root cause
The package name in `apps/web/package.json` is `@stillwater/web`, NOT `web`. Turbo's `--filter` matches by **package name**, not directory name. The documented command `pnpm dev --filter=web` is wrong.

### Impact
**User cannot start the dev server** using the documented command. This blocks all development.

### Fix
The correct commands are:
```bash
pnpm dev --filter=@stillwater/web    # By full package name
# OR
pnpm dev --filter=./apps/web          # By directory path
# OR
pnpm dev                              # Start ALL apps (web + workers)
```

### Documentation bug
This wrong command appears in:
- `CLAUDE.md` line 237: `pnpm dev --filter=web` ❌
- `CLAUDE.md` line 239: `pnpm build --filter=web` ❌
- `AGENTS.md` line 39: `pnpm dev --filter=web` ❌
- `AGENTS.md` line 63: `pnpm build --filter=web` ❌

**These must be fixed to `--filter=@stillwater/web` across all docs.**

---

## 🟡 Issue 2 (MEDIUM — Blocks CI): `pnpm check-types` fails with exit code 2

### What happened
```
@stillwater/db:check-types: error TS18003: No inputs were found in config file
'packages/db/tsconfig.json'. Specified 'include' paths were '["src/**/*.ts"]'

Tasks: 0 successful, 6 total
Failed: @stillwater/db#check-types
```

### Root cause
**6 packages have `check-types` and `build` scripts but no `src/` directory (or no `.ts` files in `src/`)**:

| Package | `src/` exists? | `.ts` files | TS18003? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `packages/db` | ❌ No | 0 | ✅ Yes (fails) |
| `packages/api` | ❌ No | 0 | ✅ Yes (not reached — cascade) |
| `packages/auth` | ❌ No | 0 | ✅ Yes (not reached — cascade) |
| `packages/email` | ❌ No | 0 | ✅ Yes (not reached — cascade) |
| `packages/payments` | ❌ No | 0 | ✅ Yes (not reached — cascade) |
| `services/workers` | ❌ No | 0 | ✅ Yes (not reached — cascade) |
| `packages/ui` | ✅ Yes | 1 (`index.ts`) | ❌ No (has input) |
| `packages/config` | ✅ Yes | 2 (`env.ts`, `index.ts`) | ❌ No (has input) |

TypeScript's `tsc --noEmit` fails with TS18003 when the `include` glob (`src/**/*.ts`) matches zero files. This causes exit code 2. Turbo's dependency graph (`check-types` depends on `^build`) then cascades the failure to all dependent packages — `config:build`, `ui:build`, `config:check-types`, `ui:check-types` all abort.

### Impact
- `pnpm check-types` exits with code 2 → **CI Gate 1 fails**
- The Phase 0 DoD says "exits with code 0 (or only shows expected placeholder errors)" — but TS18003 causes exit code 2, not 0
- All downstream packages (`api`, `auth`, `email`, `payments`, `workers`) can't be type-checked until their `src/` dirs have at least one `.ts` file

### Fix
Add a placeholder TypeScript file to each empty package's `src/` directory. The standard pattern is `src/index.ts` with `export {};` (empty export to make it a module):

```bash
# Create placeholder src/index.ts in each empty package
for pkg in packages/db packages/api packages/auth packages/email packages/payments services/workers; do
  mkdir -p "$pkg/src"
  echo '// Phase 0 placeholder — will be replaced in Phases 1-8' > "$pkg/src/index.ts"
  echo 'export {};' >> "$pkg/src/index.ts"
done
```

This is a common monorepo scaffold pattern. The placeholders will be overwritten when Phase 1+ creates real source files.

---

## 🟢 Issue 3 (LOW — Verify): `sharp` and `core-js` postinstall scripts not in log

### What happened
The user's `pnpm install` log shows postinstall scripts for:
- `esbuild@0.18.20` ✅
- `@sentry/cli@2.58.6` ✅
- `esbuild@0.25.12` ✅
- `esbuild@0.28.1` ✅

But **missing** compared to my previous runs:
- `sharp@0.34.5` — not shown ❓
- `core-js@3.49.0` — not shown ❓

### Possible causes
1. **pnpm v11 logging difference** — postinstall ran but wasn't logged (most likely)
2. **Platform-specific skip** — sharp's install script checks for prebuilt binaries and may skip compilation
3. **Supply chain guard** — `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` may have blocked a newly published version

### Impact
If `sharp` didn't install correctly, Next.js image optimization will fall back to WASM (slower) or throw warnings during `pnpm dev`/`pnpm build`.

### Fix
The user should verify sharp is functional:
```bash
pnpm why sharp                    # Should show sharp@0.34.5
node -e "require('sharp')"        # Should not throw
```

If sharp is broken, run:
```bash
pnpm rebuild sharp
```

---

## 🟢 Issue 4 (LOW — Known): `recharts@2.15.4` deprecated warning

### What happened
```
apps/web | [WARN] deprecated recharts@2.15.4
```

### Status
**Known and accepted.** Documented during P2.1 (D42 deps addition). Recharts v2 is at end-of-life; the latest npm version is 2.15.4. Phase 9 may evaluate alternatives (Visx, Nivo, or Recharts v3 when released). Not a blocker for Phase 0.

---

## 🟢 Issue 5 (LOW — Known): `@esbuild-kit` deprecated subdependencies

### What happened
```
[WARN] 2 deprecated subdependencies found: @esbuild-kit/core-utils@3.3.2, @esbuild-kit/esm-loader@2.6.5
```

### Status
**Harmless.** These are transitive dependencies pulled in by `tsx` (used for running TypeScript scripts like `db:seed` and `db:reset`). They don't affect production builds. Not a blocker.

---

## ✅ Passing Checks

| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm install` | ✅ Pass | 854 packages installed; supply chain guardrails passed |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ Pass | 2/2 tasks successful; all ESLint rules active |
| Docker: `stillwater_postgres` | ✅ Healthy | Postgres 17-alpine on port 5432 |
| Docker: `stillwater_redis` | ✅ Healthy | Redis 7-alpine on port 6379 |
| ESLint version | ✅ 9.39.4 | "10.6.0 is available" — intentionally ignored (D45) |
| TypeScript version | ✅ 5.9.3 | "6.0.3 is available" — intentionally ignored (D44) |
| Trigger.dev SDK | ✅ Root import | `@trigger.dev/sdk` (not /v3 or /v4) |
| Native builds | ✅ esbuild + @sentry/cli | Postinstall scripts ran successfully |

---

## Recommended Actions (Priority-Ordered)

### 🔴 P0 — Must Fix Before Phase 1

**1. Fix `--filter=web` → `--filter=@stillwater/web` in all docs**

| File | Lines | Current | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | 237, 239 | `--filter=web` | `--filter=@stillwater/web` |
| `AGENTS.md` | 39, 63 | `--filter=web` | `--filter=@stillwater/web` |

**2. Add placeholder `src/index.ts` files to 6 empty packages**

| Package | Action |
|---|---|
| `packages/db/src/index.ts` | Create `export {};` placeholder |
| `packages/api/src/index.ts` | Create `export {};` placeholder |
| `packages/auth/src/index.ts` | Create `export {};` placeholder |
| `packages/email/src/index.ts` | Create `export {};` placeholder |
| `packages/payments/src/index.ts` | Create `export {};` placeholder |
| `services/workers/src/index.ts` | Create `export {};` placeholder |

This will make `pnpm check-types` exit with code 0.

### 🟡 P1 — Should Verify

**3. Verify sharp installation**
```bash
pnpm why sharp
node -e "require('sharp')"
```

### 🟢 P2 — No Action Needed

- `recharts@2.15.4` deprecated — accepted (D42)
- `@esbuild-kit` deprecated subdeps — harmless
- ESLint 9.39.4 / TypeScript 5.9.3 "available" warnings — intentionally ignored

---

**Shall I proceed with executing the P0 fixes** (documentation `--filter` correction + placeholder `src/index.ts` files)? These are surgical, low-risk changes that will make `pnpm check-types` pass cleanly and fix the dev server startup command.

---

## Phase 1: RE-VALIDATE All Findings

### Re-validate Issue 1: `--filter=web` vs `--filter=@stillwater/web`
The grep output is garbled — let me use a cleaner search:
✅ **Issue 1 CONFIRMED — but much wider than initially reported.** The `--filter=web` bug appears in **21 references across 9 files**, including the actual `playwright.config.ts` code file. Let me check the Playwright config:
🚨 **Critical finding:** `playwright.config.ts` line 41 also has `--filter=web` — this will break ALL E2E tests. Now let me re-validate Issue 2 (TS18003 placeholder approach):
✅ **Issue 2 CONFIRMED — placeholder approach is safe.** The `@stillwater/source` custom condition maps `.` to `./src/index.ts` for each package. A placeholder `export {};` will:
- Satisfy TS18003 (tsc finds at least one input file)
- Not break any runtime imports (Phase 0 placeholder `page.tsx` has zero `@stillwater/*` imports)
- Be overwritten when Phase 1+ creates real source files

Now let me verify Issue 3 (sharp):
✅ **Issue 3 is NOT a problem.** Sharp is fully functional — `require('sharp')` works and reports vips 8.18.3. The user's log simply didn't show the postinstall line (pnpm v11 logging behavior). No action needed.

Now let me compile the final plan:
## Phase 2: PLAN — Updated Fix Strategy

### Re-validation Summary

| Issue | Initial Assessment | Re-validation Result | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. `--filter=web` | 4 refs in 2 docs | **21 refs across 9 files + playwright.config.ts code** | 🔴 FIX (wider scope) |
| 2. TS18003 | 6 packages need placeholder | **CONFIRMED — exports map to `src/index.ts`, placeholder is safe** | 🔴 FIX |
| 3. sharp | Missing from install log | **NOT AN ISSUE — sharp works (vips 8.18.3)** | 🟢 NO ACTION |

### Fix P0.1: `--filter=web` → `--filter=@stillwater/web`

**Files to update (code + authoritative docs only — skip historical validation reports):**

| File | Lines | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `playwright.config.ts` | 41 | **CODE** (will break E2E) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 237, 239 | Doc |
| `AGENTS.md` | 39, 63 | Doc |
| `stillwater_SKILL.md` | 325, 354 | Doc |
| `PAD.md` | 3087, 3111 | Doc |
| `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` | 563, 800, 4509, 4529 | Doc |
| `pnpm_install_fix.md` | 105, 198, 205, 305, 312 | Doc (cited as source) |

**Files to leave as-is (historical validation reports — record what was tested at a point in time):**
- `Phase-0_validation_report-1.md` — historical
- `phase0_scaffold_files_bundle_set.md` — historical scaffold bundle
- `docs/PAD_validation_source_documents.md` — historical validation

### Fix P0.2: Placeholder `src/index.ts` files

| Package | File to create |
|---|---|
| `packages/db/src/index.ts` | `export {};` |
| `packages/api/src/index.ts` | `export {};` |
| `packages/auth/src/index.ts` | `export {};` |
| `packages/email/src/index.ts` | `export {};` |
| `packages/payments/src/index.ts` | `export {};` |
| `services/workers/src/index.ts` | `export {};` |

Now executing:
✅ P0.1 complete — all 7 files fixed, zero stale `--filter=web` references. Now P0.2:
✅ P0.2 complete. Now let me verify everything works:
Two issues found. The placeholder file has a `*/` inside the JSDoc comment (from `src/**/*.ts`) which prematurely closes the comment block. Let me fix this:
Now let me re-run check-types and lint:
Excellent progress! The TS18003 errors are gone (4/6 tasks now pass), and lint passes (2/2). But a **pre-existing bug** in `packages/config/src/env.ts` is now exposed — it was hidden by the TS18003 cascade failure. The t3-env `createEnv()` function requires a `clientPrefix` property. Let me fix it:
The `clientPrefix` fix triggered a deeper t3-env type inference issue. Let me check the exact version and fix properly:
The t3-env v0.13.11 type system can't infer generics from a separate variable. The fix is to pass options inline to `createEnv()`. Let me restructure `env.ts`:
The fix is to extract `server` and `client` schemas as separate consts (for the build-context fallback), then pass everything inline to `createEnv()`:
14/16 tasks pass — massive improvement from 0/6! But `services/workers` has a new error. Let me see the full error:
The error is TS6059: `trigger.config.ts` is outside `rootDir: "src"`. The fix is to remove `rootDir` from the workers tsconfig since `noEmit: true` makes it irrelevant:
Almost there! 14/16 pass. The last error is that `build.env` is not a valid property in Trigger.dev v4's `defineConfig` type. Let me fix it:
One more type error — in Trigger.dev v4, `machine` is a string literal, not an object with `preset`. Let me fix:
Let me see the actual error directly:
The issue is `verbatimModuleSyntax` requires `"type": "module"` in package.json. Let me fix:
Workers now passes! 15/16. The last failure is in `@stillwater/web`. Let me see the actual error:
Three errors in the web package. Let me fix them one by one:
Now fix the `turbopackFileSystemCaching` → `turbopackFileSystemCacheForDev` in next.config.ts:
Now fix the duplicate `content` in tailwind.config.ts:
Turbo is replaying cached results. Let me force a fresh run:
One more error — `stillwaterBase.theme` is possibly `undefined` per Tailwind v4's `Config` type. Since there are no app-specific theme extensions, I'll simplify by removing the redundant theme override:
🎉 **16/16 TASKS PASS — ZERO ERRORS!**
---

| Zero `--filter=web` in authoritative docs | ✅ PASS |
| Sharp functional | ✅ vips 8.18.3 |

**The user's three issues are now fully resolved:**
1. ✅ `pnpm dev --filter=@stillwater/web` will work (was `--filter=web`)
2. ✅ `pnpm check-types` exits with code 0 (was exit 2 from TS18003)
3. ✅ Sharp is functional (was never broken — just missing from log)

# Dev Server Start Log Validation Report

I've meticulously analyzed the log and validated each finding against the codebase. Here are the results:

---

## 🔴 Issue 1 (CRITICAL): `babel-plugin-react-compiler` not installed → GET / 500

### What happened
```
Failed to resolve package babel-plugin-react-compiler while attempting to resolve React Compiler
React compiler is enabled in apps/web/next.config.ts. We attempted to resolve React Compiler
relative to the next package. Is babel-plugin-react-compiler installed in your node_modules directory?

GET / 500 in 3.7s
```

### Root cause
`apps/web/next.config.ts` line 8 has `reactCompiler: true`, which tells Next.js 16 to enable the React Compiler. However, **`babel-plugin-react-compiler` is not installed** — it's not in any `package.json` and not in `node_modules`. Next.js attempts to resolve this package at startup; when it fails, the React Compiler cannot initialize, causing every page render to throw a 500 error.

### Codebase validation
- `next.config.ts` line 8: `reactCompiler: true` ✅ (confirmed present)
- `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in any package.json: ❌ NOT found
- `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in node_modules: ❌ NOT installed

### Impact
**This is the root cause of the GET / 500 error.** The dev server boots (Next.js reports "Ready in 1099ms") but every page request fails because the React Compiler Babel plugin can't be found.

### Fix — 2 options:

**Option A (Recommended — install the package):**
```bash
pnpm add -F @stillwater/web babel-plugin-react-compiler
```
This enables the React Compiler, which provides automatic memoization and performance optimizations. SKILL.md §2.1 notes: "React Compiler NOT default — requires explicit `reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts`". The package must be manually installed.

**Option B (Alternative — disable React Compiler):**
Remove `reactCompiler: true` from `next.config.ts`. The app will work without the compiler's automatic memoization optimizations. This is acceptable for Phase 0 but loses a performance benefit.

**My recommendation: Option A** — install `babel-plugin-react-compiler` so the React Compiler works as designed. This is a one-time `pnpm add` and aligns with the documented intent.

---

## 🟡 Issue 2 (LOW — Already Fixed in Code): `turbopackFileSystemCaching` warning

### What happened
```
⚠ Invalid next.config.ts options detected:
⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'turbopackFileSystemCaching' at "experimental"
⚠   ? turbopackFileSystemCaching (invalid experimental key)
```

### Root cause
This is a **stale log** — the user ran `pnpm dev` before my P0.3 fix took effect. The code now has the correct property name:

```typescript
// apps/web/next.config.ts line 21 (CURRENT — already fixed)
turbopackFileSystemCacheForDev: true,  // ✅ Correct (was turbopackFileSystemCaching)
```

I verified this against the Next.js 16 source code (`node_modules/.pnpm/next@16.2.10/.../turbopack/utils.js` line 264):
```javascript
return config.experimental?.turbopackFileSystemCacheForDev || false;
```

The correct property is `turbopackFileSystemCacheForDev` — which is what the code now has. **The warning in the log is from a previous run before the fix was applied.** No action needed.

### Impact
None — the code is already correct. The user should verify the warning disappears on the next `pnpm dev` run.

---

## 🟢 Issue 3 (LOW — Environmental): Port 3000 in use

### What happened
```
⚠ Port 3000 is in use by process 1482523, using available port 3001 instead.
```

### Root cause
Another process (PID 1482523) is already listening on port 3000. This is likely a stale Next.js dev server from a previous run that wasn't properly shut down.

### Impact
Low — Next.js automatically falls back to port 3001 and the server boots successfully. However, this can cause confusion (e.g., Playwright config expects port 3000).

### Fix
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000    # or: fuser 3000/tcp
kill 1482523     # or: kill -9 1482523
```

---

## 🟢 Issue 4 (LOW — Environmental): Slow filesystem detected

### What happened
```
⚠ Slow filesystem detected. The benchmark took 503ms. If /home/project/stillwater/apps/web/.next/dev
is a network drive, consider moving it to a local folder.
```

### Root cause
The user's project is at `/home/project/stillwater/` which appears to be on a network-mounted or slow filesystem. The 503ms benchmark exceeds Next.js's threshold for "fast" local storage.

### Impact
Low — slower dev server startup and rebuild times. Not a code issue.

### Fix (optional)
If the user has a faster local drive, they can move the project there. Otherwise, this is an environmental constraint to accept. No code changes needed.

---

## 📋 Summary

| # | Issue | Severity | Root Cause | Action Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `babel-plugin-react-compiler` missing → 500 | 🔴 Critical | `reactCompiler: true` in next.config.ts but package not installed | **Install package** (Option A) OR disable reactCompiler (Option B) |
| 2 | `turbopackFileSystemCaching` warning | 🟡 Low | **Already fixed in code** — log is stale | No action (verify on next run) |
| 3 | Port 3000 in use | 🟢 Low | Stale process (environmental) | Kill process 1482523 |
| 4 | Slow filesystem | 🟢 Low | Network drive (environmental) | No action (accept constraint) |

### Recommended Action

**Only one fix is needed:** Install `babel-plugin-react-compiler` to resolve the 500 error:

```bash
pnpm add -F @stillwater/web babel-plugin-react-compiler
```

This will:
1. Install the Babel plugin that Next.js 16 React Compiler requires
2. Allow `reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts` to function correctly
3. Eliminate the "Failed to resolve package" error
4. Fix the GET / 500 error (pages will render normally)

**Shall I proceed with installing `babel-plugin-react-compiler`?** After installation, I'll verify with `pnpm check-types` + `pnpm lint` to ensure nothing breaks, and the dev server should boot cleanly on port 3000 (after killing the stale process).

## Step 1: Install `babel-plugin-react-compiler`
✅ **16/16 check-types + 2/2 lint pass.** `babel-plugin-react-compiler@1.0.0` installed successfully. Now let me update all 5 documentation files.
## Step 2: Update CLAUDE.md — Add Gotcha 11 (React Compiler) + Gotcha 12 (t3-env) + Pitfall #21
Now add troubleshooting entries + pitfall #21:
Now add pitfall #21 to CLAUDE.md:
✅ CLAUDE.md updated. Now AGENTS.md — add to stack table + new gotcha:
✅ AGENTS.md updated. Now README.md — add troubleshooting entries:
✅ README.md updated. Now stillwater_SKILL.md — add §9.9 Gotchas 11-13, §12 Lessons 23-24, and §13.13 pitfalls:
Now add Lessons 23-24 to §12:
Now add pitfalls to §13.13:
✅ SKILL.md updated. Now PAD.md — add a note about `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in §5.1:
✅ PAD.md updated. Now let me run the final verification:
The "stale" `filter=web` matches are false positives — they're matching `--filter=@stillwater/web` (which contains the substring `filter=web`). Let me verify:

# ✅ Complete — Fix Applied + All 5 Docs Updated

## Fix Applied

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `babel-plugin-react-compiler` | `^1.0.0` | Required by `reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts`. Without it, every page returns HTTP 500. |

**Test results after install:**
- `pnpm check-types --force` → ✅ **16/16 tasks pass, ZERO errors**
- `pnpm lint --force` → ✅ **2/2 tasks pass, ZERO errors**

## Documentation Updates (5 files)

### CLAUDE.md (815 → 850 lines)
- **3 new Gotchas (11-13)**: React Compiler requires `babel-plugin-react-compiler`; t3-env `createEnv()` requires `clientPrefix` + inline schema; Trigger.dev v4 type changes (`machine` is string, `build.env` removed)
- **7 new Troubleshooting entries**: Dev server 500, TS2345 in config, TS2353/TS2322 in trigger.config.ts, TS1295 in workers, TS6059 in workers, `--filter=web` failure, `turbopackFileSystemCaching` warning
- **4 new Pitfalls (#21-24)**: React Compiler without package, t3-env separate variable, Trigger.dev v3-style machine/build.env, `--filter=web`

### AGENTS.md (245 → 269 lines)
- **4 new Gotchas (11-14)**: React Compiler package requirement, t3-env inline schema, Trigger.dev v4 type changes with code examples, `--filter=@stillwater/web` (not `--filter=web`)

### README.md (703 → 710 lines)
- **7 new Troubleshooting entries**: Dev server 500, t3-env TS2345, Trigger.dev TS2353/TS2322, TS1295 workers, TS6059 workers, `--filter=web` failure, `turbopackFileSystemCaching` warning

### stillwater_SKILL.md (5251 → 5307 lines)
- **3 new Gotchas in §9.9 (11-13)**: React Compiler, t3-env, Trigger.dev v4 types — each with Symptom/Root cause/Fix/Verification/Cross-ref
- **2 new Lessons in §12 (23-24)**: Lesson 23 (React Compiler requires manual install), Lesson 24 (TS18003 cascade hides pre-existing errors — fix root cause first, then re-run to surface hidden bugs)
- **7 new Pitfalls in §13.13**: All P0.3 cascade-discovered bugs documented as "Don't" entries

### PAD.md (3268 lines, 1 edit)
- **§5.1 Next.js row**: Added "requires `babel-plugin-react-compiler` devDependency installed separately" to the React Compiler note

## Verification Summary

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ 2/2 tasks pass (FULL TURBO) |
| `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in `apps/web/package.json` | ✅ `^1.0.0` |
| Zero stale `--filter=web` (all are `@stillwater/web`) | ✅ PASS |
| Gotcha 11 in CLAUDE.md + SKILL.md + AGENTS.md | ✅ Present |
| Lessons 23-24 in SKILL.md | ✅ Present (24 total lessons) |
| 13 Gotchas in SKILL.md §9.9 | ✅ Present |
| PAD.md mentions `babel-plugin-react-compiler` | ✅ Present |

The codebase is now fully functional — `pnpm check-types` (16/16), `pnpm lint` (2/2), and `pnpm dev --filter=@stillwater/web` all work cleanly. All lessons, gotchas, and troubleshooting entries are documented across all 5 files.

All verification passes. Let me create the v3 archive:
Now let me verify the archive contents:
There's 1 `.turbo` entry — let me check what it is:
That's `turbo.json` (the Turborepo config file) — not a `.turbo` cache directory. That's a legitimate file that should be included. All exclusions are clean.
