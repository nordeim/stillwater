## Detailed Findings

### Finding #1: `forwardRef` Usage in Button Component (§5.5)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §3.1  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §5.5 (Button variant customization)

**Issue:** The Button component example in §5.5 uses `forwardRef`:

```typescript
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-water-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-sand-50 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",
  { ... }
);
```

However, the `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill explicitly states in §3.1:

> "React 19 ready" — the skill shows a Button component that uses `forwardRef` but notes it's "React 19 ready" implying `ref` as regular prop is the preferred pattern.

**The source skill `nextjs16-tailwind4` §3.1 actually uses `forwardRef`** in its example, so the Stillwater SKILL.md is consistent with the source. However, §9.6 of the Stillwater SKILL.md correctly documents `forwardRef` as an anti-pattern:

> "Bug: `forwardRef` (Medium) — React 19 allows `ref` as regular prop."

**Verdict:** The SKILL.md §9.6 anti-pattern section is correct. The §5.5 example could be updated to use the React 19 pattern for consistency, but this is a **minor inconsistency** within the document, not a fidelity issue with the source.

**Severity:** Low — Internal inconsistency, not source fidelity issue.

---

### Finding #2: `focus-visible:outline-none` vs `focus-visible:ring` (§5.5)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.3, `tailwind-patterns` §11  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §5.5 (Button variant customization)

**Issue:** The Button component in §5.5 uses:

```
focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-water-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-sand-50
```

However, the `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.3 notes that in Tailwind v4:

> "`outline-none` → `outline-hidden` (Semantic clarity)"

The `tailwind-patterns` source skill §11 also notes:

> "Don't: `outline-none` | Do: `outline-hidden`"

**Verdict:** The Stillwater SKILL.md uses `focus-visible:outline-none` which is the v3 pattern. It should use `focus-visible:outline-hidden` for Tailwind v4 consistency.

**Severity:** Medium — Tailwind v4 migration issue.

**Fix:** Replace `focus-visible:outline-none` with `focus-visible:outline-hidden` in §5.5.

---

### Finding #3: Missing `verification-before-completion.md` Iron Law Details (§11)

**Source Skill:** `verification-and-review-protocol` (references `verification-before-completion.md`)  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §11.1

**Issue:** The Stillwater SKILL.md §11.1 correctly states:

> "THE IRON LAW: No completion claims without fresh verification evidence."

However, the source skill `verification-and-review-protocol` provides more specific guidance that could strengthen the Stillwater SKILL.md:

1. **Red Flags from source:** "Using words like 'should', 'probably', 'seems to'" — not explicitly mentioned in Stillwater
2. **Gate Function from source:** `IDENTIFY command → RUN full command → READ output → VERIFY confirms claim → THEN claim` — the Stillwater version is less structured
3. **Verification requirements from source:** "Tests pass: Terminal output explicitly shows 0 failures" — the Stillwater version is less specific

**Verdict:** The Iron Law is present but less detailed than the source.

**Severity:** Low — Core concept captured, but missing operational detail.

**Enhancement:** Add the specific red flags and gate function structure from the source skill.

---

### Finding #4: Missing `@reference` Pattern for `@apply` in Scoped Styles (§13.6)

**Source Skill:** `tailwind-patterns` (implicit), `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.5  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §9.5 (Tailwind v4 Anti-Patterns)

**Issue:** The Stillwater SKILL.md §9.5 correctly documents:

> "Bug: `@apply` in scoped styles without `@reference` (Medium) — Fix: Add `@reference "../../app.css";` first."

However, the `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.5 provides more context:

> "No `@apply` in scoped styles without `@reference`: In CSS Modules or SFC, you may need `@reference "../../app.css";` before `@apply`."

The Stillwater SKILL.md captures this correctly. No issue found.

**Verdict:** Accurate.

---

### Finding #5: Missing `@source` Directive Guidance (§13.6)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.5  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §13.6 (Tailwind v4 Pitfalls)

**Issue:** The Stillwater SKILL.md §13.6 mentions:

> "Don't forget `@source` directives in monorepo — explicitly limit scanning scope."

However, the `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.5 provides more specific guidance:

> "@source scanning: Explicitly limit scanning scope for monorepos and `node_modules` to prevent build slowdown."

The Stillwater SKILL.md captures this, but could be more specific about **why** this matters in a Turborepo monorepo context.

**Verdict:** Accurate but could be enhanced.

**Severity:** Low — Concept present, detail could be richer.

---

### Finding #6: Missing `container queries` Coverage (§17)

**Source Skill:** `tailwind-patterns` §3, `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.4  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §17 (Responsive Breakpoint Reference)

**Issue:** The Stillwater SKILL.md §17 covers viewport breakpoints but does not mention Tailwind v4's native container queries. The source skill `tailwind-patterns` §3 explicitly covers:

> "**Container Queries**: Built-in `@container` and `@sm:`, `@md:`, `@lg:`, etc."

The `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.4 also notes:

> "Container Queries: Built-in `@container` and `@sm:`, `@max-md:`, etc. Enables truly component-driven responsive behaviour."

**Verdict:** Missing content from source skills.

**Severity:** Medium — Important Tailwind v4 feature not covered.

**Enhancement:** Add a §17.4 section on Container Queries with usage patterns.

---

### Finding #7: Missing `data-attribute variants` Coverage (§4)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.4  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §4 (Design System)

**Issue:** The `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.4 notes:

> "Data attribute variants: `data-current:opacity-100` for state-driven styling without JavaScript."

This is not mentioned in the Stillwater SKILL.md.

**Verdict:** Missing content from source skill.

**Severity:** Low — Nice-to-have feature documentation.

---

### Finding #8: Missing `OKLCH Color Space` Recommendation (§4, §19)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.4, `tailwind-patterns` §7  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §4, §19

**Issue:** Both source skills recommend OKLCH for color definitions:

- `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.4: "OKLCH color space: Provides wider gamut and perceptually uniform gradients"
- `tailwind-patterns` §7: "OKLCH | Perceptually uniform, better for design"

The Stillwater SKILL.md uses hex colors exclusively in §19.

**Verdict:** Source skills recommend OKLCH; Stillwater uses hex. This is a **design decision** (hex is simpler for the Warm Mineral palette), not a fidelity issue. However, a note about OKLCH as an alternative would be valuable.

**Severity:** Low — Design choice, not accuracy issue.

---

### Finding #9: Missing `inset shadows & rings` Coverage (§4)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.4  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §4 (Design System)

**Issue:** The `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.4 notes:

> "Inset shadows & rings: `inset-shadow-*`, `inset-ring-*` add depth while maintaining minimalism."

This is not mentioned in the Stillwater SKILL.md. However, since Stillwater bans shadows (§1.3), this is intentionally excluded.

**Verdict:** Intentionally excluded per design philosophy. No issue.

---

### Finding #10: Missing `gradient interpolation modifiers` Coverage (§4)

**Source Skill:** `nextjs16-tailwind4` §2.4  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §4 (Design System)

**Issue:** The `nextjs16-tailwind4` source skill §2.4 notes:

> "Gradient interpolation modifiers: `bg-linear-to-r/oklch` for smooth, vibrant gradients."

Since Stillwater bans gradients (§1.3), this is intentionally excluded.

**Verdict:** Intentionally excluded per design philosophy. No issue.

---

### Finding #11: Missing `Six-Axis Review` Explicit Reference (§11)

**Source Skill:** `code-quality-standards`  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §11 (Pre-Ship Checklist)

**Issue:** The `code-quality-standards` source skill explicitly defines the **Six-Axis Review**:
1. Correctness
2. Readability & Simplicity
3. Architecture
4. Security
5. Performance
6. Aesthetic & UX Rigor (Anti-Generic Mandate)

The Stillwater SKILL.md §11.4 (Architecture Validation Checklist) covers these axes implicitly but does not explicitly reference the Six-Axis framework. The "Anti-Generic Litmus Test" (§1.4) is present, which covers Axis 6.

**Verdict:** Content present but not explicitly tied to the Six-Axis framework.

**Severity:** Low — Implicit coverage, could be more explicit.

---

### Finding #12: Missing `Multi-Model Review Pattern` (§11)

**Source Skill:** `code-quality-standards`  
**Stillwater SKILL.md:** §11 (Pre-Ship Checklist)

**Issue:** The `code-quality-standards` source skill describes a **Multi-Model Review Pattern**:

> "Use different models for different review perspectives: Model A writes code → Model B reviews → Model A addresses feedback → Human makes final call"

This pattern is not mentioned in the Stillwater SKILL.md.

**Verdict:** Missing from source skill.

**Severity:** Low — Nice-to-have process documentation.

| TypeScript | `^5.7.3` | `5.9+` in source | ✅ Compatible |
| Better Auth | `^1.6.23` | `1.6.23` in source | ✅ Exact match |
| pnpm | `9.15.4` | `>=9.0.0` in source | ✅ Compatible |
| Drizzle ORM | `^0.40.1` | Project-specific | ✅ Project-specific |

### Anti-Pattern Accuracy

| Anti-Pattern | Source Skill Reference | Stillwater Coverage | Correct? |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| `forwardRef` in React 19 | `nextjs16-tailwind4` §3.1 | §9.6 | ✅ Correct |
| `useMemo`/`useCallback` | `nextjs16-react-expert` | §9.6 | ✅ Correct |
| `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` | `authjs-vs-better-auth` | §9.1 | ✅ Correct |
| `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` | `nextjs16-tailwind4` | §9.1 | ✅ Correct |
| Synchronous `params` | `nextjs16-tailwind4` | §9.1 | ✅ Correct |
| `any` type | `code-quality-standards` | §9.2 | ✅ Correct |
| `enum`/`namespace` | TypeScript strict mode | §9.2 | ✅ Correct |
| `vi.fn()` in `vi.mock()` | `testing-patterns` | §9.8 | ✅ Correct |
| Dynamic class interpolation | `tailwind-patterns` | §9.5 | ✅ Correct |
| `bg-opacity-*` → opacity modifiers | `tailwind-patterns` §5 | §9.5 | ✅ Correct |

### Auth Pattern Accuracy

| Pattern | Source: `authjs-vs-better-auth` | Stillwater §5.6 | Correct? |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| `auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })` | ✅ Documented | ✅ Present | ✅ |
| `authClient.signIn.social({ provider })` | ✅ Documented | ✅ Present | ✅ |
| `authClient.useSession()` returns `{ data, error, refetch, isPending }` | ✅ Documented | ✅ Present | ✅ |
| Route handler: `[...all]` not `[...nextauth]` | ✅ Documented | ✅ Present | ✅ |
| `getSessionCookie(request)` for proxy.ts | ✅ Documented | ✅ Present | ✅ |
| `toNextJsHandler(auth)` | ✅ Documented | ❌ Missing | ⚠️ |
| Database schema differences (User, Session, Account, Verification) | ✅ Documented | ❌ Missing | ⚠️ |

**Note:** The `toNextJsHandler` pattern and database schema mapping are present in the `authjs-vs-better-auth` source skill but not explicitly in the Stillwater SKILL.md. The Stillwater SKILL.md focuses on the route handler pattern from the project perspective, which is reasonable.
